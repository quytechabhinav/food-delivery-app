## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/food-delivery-app.git
   cd food-delivery-app
   ```

2. Install the dependencies for both the frontend and backend:

   ```bash
   # Install frontend dependencies
   cd client
   npm install

   # Install backend dependencies
   cd ../server
   npm install
   ```

### Configuration

1. Configure the database:

   - Create a MySQL database and import the provided SQL schema located in the `server/database` directory.

   - Update the database configuration in `server/config/db.config.js` with your database credentials:

     ```javascript
     module.exports = {
       HOST: "your-database-host",
       USER: "your-database-username",
       PASSWORD: "your-database-password",
       DB: "your-database-name",
     };
     ```

2. Configure environment variables:

   Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and define the following variables:

   ```env
   PORT=3001   # Port for the Node.js server
   JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
   ```

### Usage

1. Start the backend server:

   ```bash
   cd server
   npm start
   ```

   The server will start on the port you defined in the `.env` file.

2. Start the frontend development server:

   ```bash
   cd client
   npm start
   ```

   The React app will run on port 3000 by default.

3. Access the application in your web browser:

   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

## Database

The MySQL database schema is provided in the `server/database` directory. It includes tables for users, restaurants, menus, orders, reviews, and more. You can customize and extend the schema to suit your application's needs.
